    <p class="descriptions">
      I am a Computer Science (Bachelor of Science) student at Northeastern
      University, specializing in a Human Centered Computing conecentration. My
      mission is to revolutionize product design and web development by
      integrating minimalistic and appealing design. I am dedicated to enhancing
      accessibility, transparency, and usability in every project I undertake. I
      am a Lead UI/UX and Frontend Developer at Meditation Artifacts, an
      education company formed within the Harvard Innovation by professional
      religious scholars. Right now, I am designing and helping build a web app
      which will help us collect key user metrics and feedback on our designs
      and recomendation system. I am excited to announce that I will be working
      as a User Experience Designer at Symbotic LLC this coming Spring. As part
      of this role I will contribute to developing and maintaining the Symbotic
      UI Design System. I will also organize and facilitate user testing
      sessions, collaborating closely with UX Researchers, Principal and Senior
      designers, and development stakeholders. Lastly, I will get to advocate
      for end-users, UX Research & Design processes and methodologies,
      innovation, usability and accessibility, and the creation and guidance of
      interface standards. This is an exciting, "hands-on" opportunity that I
      think will help deepen by understanding of targeting user needs and
      understanding user behavior.
