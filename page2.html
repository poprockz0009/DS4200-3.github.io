      <h3 style="color: orchid">Meditation Artifacts MVP</h3>
      <p>
        Leading the design and user experience for a groundbreaking meditation
        app developed by Harvard religious studies scholars, I created a minimal
        viable product (MVP) using Figma to produce interactive wireframes.
        These wireframes received positive feedback on the UI appeal and brand
        differentiation from investors, stakeholders and advisors, including
        former CTO of Kayak (Paul English) and are pivotal in securing further
        investment. The wireframes were also tested among potential users (those
        who would pay for the product and/or signed up for future beta testing)
        through survey testing and expressed positive emotions towards the
        design and feel of the product. Key Achievements: Developed MVP for
        investor presentation. Established design principles, color and general
        style guidelines for the MAI brand. Skills: User Interface (UI), Product
        Lifecycle, User Experience (UX), Figma

      <p>
        Designed and developed the user interface for an AI-driven IT chat tool
        at Harvard Kennedy School with another frontend designer and developer.
        This tool, developed in compliance with Harvard's design guidelines,
        will reduce IT support requests by approximately 50% through efficient,
        tailored responses and an accessible, user-friendly UI. Key
        Achievements: Cut assistance needs by ~50% through enhanced UI/UX
        design. Languages: JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, HTML Skills: Design with
        Generative AI, Product Lifecycle, AI Ethical Policy, Accessibility,
        Security, Figma

        Achievements: Created automation-compatible designs that were presented
